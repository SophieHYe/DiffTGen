# Result

A result file (e.g., ./trial30_time60/rslt) shows, from left to right, (1) the patch id (bug_tool), (2) DiffTGen's running time (in minutes), (3) whether syntactic difference found (between the patch and the original faulty program), (4) whether semantic difference found, (5) whether regression-indicative test case generated, (6) whether repair-indicative test case generated, (7) whether defective indicative test case generated (i.e., a test case showing both the patch and the original faulty program yield incorrect outputs).
